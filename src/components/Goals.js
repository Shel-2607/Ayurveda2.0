      <h1>Our Goals</h1>
      <p>
        Our primary goal is to refine and modernize the diagnostic processes for Annavaha Srotas disorders in Ayurvedic medicine by utilizing cutting-edge AI technology. We aim to develop a comprehensive AI diagnostic tool that integrates traditional Ayurvedic knowledge with modern advancements, initially focusing on Annavaha Srotas disorders and eventually expanding to cover all Srotas-related diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
        By doing so, we seek to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnoses, ultimately improving patient outcomes and supporting a wide range of Ayurvedic clinical practices. Additionally, we strive to bridge the gap between traditional and modern medicine, fostering a synergy that advances the field of Ayurveda.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to providing educational and training resources for practitioners to effectively utilize these AI tools, and we encourage ongoing research and development to continuously improve our diagnostic systems. Through these efforts, we aim to revolutionize Ayurvedic diagnostics and elevate the quality of healthcare within this ancient medical tradition.
